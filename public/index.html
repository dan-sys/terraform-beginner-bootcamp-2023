        <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
        <p>The Internet is a global network of computers and servers that communicate with each other. It allows for the sharing and exchange of information and resources across the world.</p>

        <h2>How Does the Internet Work?</h2>
        <p>When you use the Internet, you're connecting to a network of networks. Your computer sends a request to a server, which then responds with the information you're looking for. This process involves several steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You type a URL into your web browser.</li>
            <li>Your computer sends a request to a DNS server to find the IP address of the server hosting the website.</li>
            <li>The DNS server responds with the IP address.</li>
            <li>Your computer then sends a request to the server at that IP address.</li>
            <li>The server sends back the requested web page.</li>
            <li>Your browser displays the web page.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Key Components of the Internet</h2>
        <p>There are several key components that make the Internet work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Servers:</strong> These are powerful computers that store websites, applications, and other data.</li>
            <li><strong>Routers:</strong> These devices connect multiple devices on a network and route traffic to the appropriate destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Service Providers (ISPs):</strong> These companies provide the connection between your home or business and the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
